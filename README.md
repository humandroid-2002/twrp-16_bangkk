## First-time installation
    * Download the `boot.img` file from the Releases section.  
      We currently provide unofficial builds for TWRP, OrangeFox.
    * Reboot your device to bootloader mode
    * Run:
          `fastboot boot boot.img`
    * In recovery, go to Advanced Settings and select:
          `Flash Current Recovery`
      (REQUIRED)
    * Reboot back to recovery (REQUIRED)
    * Done

## Updating the recovery
    * Download the latest `boot.img` from the Releases section
    * Connect the phone via USB and copy `boot.img` to the Download folder
    * From custom recovery, select the image and choose:
          `Install Recovery Ramdisk`
    * Reboot back to recovery
    * Done

## OTA Survival / Keep Recovery After ROM Updates
    * This device uses the A/B partition scheme.
    * When installing OTA updates or flashing custom ROMs, the system may overwrite the
      `boot` and `vendor_boot` partitions with the stock recovery.
    * To preserve your custom recovery, follow these steps:

    * Boot into recovery
    * Flash your ROM or OTA `.zip`
    * (Optional) Enable:
          `Automatically reflash recovery after installation`
    * DO NOT reboot to system yet
    * If auto-reflash was not enabled:
          Go to:
          `Advanced -> Flash Current Recovery`
    * Wait for the process to complete
    * Reboot back to recovery
          This switches the device to the newly updated active slot
    * After rebooting back into recovery, you may flash:
          * Magisk
          * Custom kernels
          * Modules / add-ons
    * Format Data if Clean Install
    * Reboot to system
